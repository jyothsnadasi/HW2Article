<h1>An Empirical Study of
Password Policy Compliance </h1>

<h1><h1>By Jyothsna Dasi</h1></h1>

<article>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>—Cybersecurity exploits that take advantage of
weak passwords continue to succeed in virtually every
industry. This motivates interest in empirically determining
the extent to which websites that invite visitors to create new
user accounts on them encourage or require users to engage in
better password management practices, including strong
passwords. This project examined a statistically significant
sample of websites to assess how closely they voluntarily adhere
to the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s
authoritative guidance on password policies. Over 100
representative websites were selected from industries that
consistently report the most breaches in the Verizon Data
Breach Investigation Report. Their respective user account
creation processes were assessed via a scorecard approach
based on observations collected when following standardized
experimental procedures. Scorecard data then were
aggregated and analyzed for trends. The research findings
highlight potential vulnerabilities that persist in online account
password creation practices, leaving many websites susceptible
to brute force attacks due to cyber hygiene lapses.
Recommendations to help remediate compliance gaps and as
paths forward to build upon this work include refining the
proposed scorecard, creating and using standardized user
registration and profile manager plugins, widely adopting
user-friendly password management tools, and enacting
tougher legal consequences for website hosts when breaches
occur.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As technology and computing power increase, so does the
ability of threat actors to compromise passwords. At the same
time, whether driven by convenience or necessity, people are
doing more professional and personal activities online than
ever before [1]; and in doing so they share relevant personal
information that businesses as well as bad actors can leverage
for their own purposes. While news of data breaches should
make everyone increasingly wary of how well data they share
online is being safeguarded by the companies that house
them, users continue to create weak passwords. According to
an online study published by YouGov, over half of all online
users are using the same passwords for most of their accounts
[4].
In short, left to their own choices, users’ passwords are
not secure despite well-publicized breach incidents and
clearly defined best practices from reputable bodies like the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
When websites invite visitors to create online accounts, but
then do not enforce compliance with authoritative password
guidance, this effectively results in a virtually endless
vulnerable attack surface for cyber criminals who seek to
breach, then exfiltrate and exploit personal and financial
information.
The goal of this project was to empirically investigate the
extent to which website hosts try to foster strong passwords
during online account creation. This research is important
because it highlights potential vulnerabilities that persist in
online account creation. In addition, it proposes a scorecard
approach for rating how closely sites follow authoritative
guidance regarding strong passwords. Together this builds a
foundation for suggesting specific ways both end users and
online hosts still may need to close the gap between being
aware of simple cybersecurity hygiene and actually putting it
into practice.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II presents background information regarding the
prevalence of weak password use and authoritative password
guidance. Section III explains methodologies used for the
experiment. Section IV discusses findings from data analysis.
Section V suggests some recommendations for remedying
password compliance gaps. Section VI summarizes the paper
and suggests ways to build upon this work.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>A. Problem Scope
Several studies have shown how a random sample of
dictionary attacks alone was able to break up to 24 percent of
tested passwords [4][5][6]. There are between 12 and 24
million ecommerce sites across all business segments [2].
Extrapolating such historical findings across every
ecommerce account ever created implies virtually every
internet user is highly likely to have data at risk via credential
breaches.
A survey of over 1000 individuals conducted by the
security giant Avast concluded that 83 percent of all users are
using weak passwords [7]. Troy Hunt, a world-renowned

expert on security and data breaches, hosts a website where
he has collected over half a billion passwords that have
appeared in known data breaches. Among his most alarming
discoveries: in just one breach involving 6.8 million records,
71 percent of those passwords were already in the database
of compromised passwords he had compiled [8].
According to a recent Verizon Data Breach Investigation
Reports (DBIR), every industry category they track has
experienced an incident in which password cracking via brute
force attack enabled the breach. In fact, the DBIR has cited
stolen or compromised credentials as the top cause of all data
breaches for many years [3]. In other words, users continue
to create weak, easily cracked passwords.
B. Authoritative Password Guidance
In 2019, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology released Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3
which outlines new recommendations for authenticating
users to combat this significant vulnerability in the account
creation process. The SP builds on findings over several
years to overturn previously accepted best practices,
replacing them with a new gold standard. As shown in Table
I, it lays out nine main points that should be considered when
creating password policies with an eye toward security and
robust authentication [11].
TABLE I. NIST PASSWORD GUIDANCE
Attribute Criteria
Length
Minimum of 8 when selected by a human; 6
when assigned by a system or service;
maximum of 64 should be allowed.
Character types All ASCII characters, including spaces,
should be allowed.
Truncation Shortening of passwords should never be
implemented.
Screening
Checking proposed passwords against
dictionaries of commonly used, easy-toguess passwords is recommended.
Complexity Requiring complexity criteria must be met is
not recommended.
Lockout Locking the account after a set number (e.g.,
10) of failed login attempts is recommended.
Expiration Requiring users to change their passwords
with high frequency is not recommended.
Knowledge-based
authentication
Hints and security questions to retrieve or
reset forgotten passwords are not
recommended.
Two-factor
authentication (2FA)
Short Message Service (SMS)-based
approaches are not recommended; one-time
rotating password applications are
acceptable.
C. Motivation for Study
Despite an abundance of authoritative password
guidance, users continue to compose weak passwords and to
reuse passwords across multiple online accounts, offering a
ubiquitous attack surface for cyber criminals. This
observation motivated interest in empirically determining the
extent to which websites that invite users to create accounts
encourage or require them to create strong passwords or to
engage in better password management practices in
alignment with NIST guidance.</p>

  <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
  <p>This project inspected the account creation process for a
statistically significant number of websites that invite visitors
to create password-protected accounts. The overall
experiment included the following five procedural elements.
A. Sample Population Selection
The DBIR rank-orders 21 industries according to the
number of reported data breaches, malware attacks, and other
cybersecurity incidents [3]. From that list, nine (9) of the
most frequently breached industries were selected:
Accommodation, Education, Finance, Healthcare,
Information, Manufacturing, Professional, Public, Retail.
Then, based on industry definitions, keywords were chosen
and used in the Google and Bing search engines to discover
industry-relevant websites that feature an account creation
process. It should be noted for the Manufacturing industry,
the existence of a process for creating an account to apply for
a job was deemed acceptable, based on the assumption that
the password policies used by human resources (HR) would
be consistent with the password policies of the company at
large.
By choosing 10 to 15 websites in each of these nine
categories, data ultimately were collected from 108 sites.
Since the number of websites on the internet is extremely
large, this sample size supported statistical calculations
accurate to within 10 to 12 percent of the overall population
statistics with high confidence.
B. Volunteer Recruitment
Due to time constraints, four student volunteers were
recruited from the Computer Science Department at Norfolk
State University to help with data collection..
C. Script and Video Creation
A script was created to standardize the collection of
experimental observations in comparison with NIST
guidance. To the maximum extent practicable, the script
focused on data collectors responding to a series of yes/no
questions while they created a user account on each selected
website, with just a few “fill-in-the-blank” answers. The
resulting script is shown in Fig.1. In addition, two
instructional videos were created to explain the data
collection process and the use of the script to student
volunteers.

D. Data Collection and Validation
Each volunteer was provided a unique subset of websites
drawn from the sample, and instructed to watch the two
instructional videos before collecting data. Data collection
involved visiting each site to create an account while
following and answering the script questions. Sample data
sheets were spot checked later to ensure collection
procedures had been followed. Minor inaccuracies were
found on just two sheets, informally validating the
repeatability of the data collection process and the accuracy
of the volunteers’ efforts.
E. Calculations and Inferences
Collected data were consolidated and summarized to
support analysis, comparing results across industries, and to
highlight significant trends. These findings and insights are
discussed in the next section.</p>

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>This research sought to provides insights about the state of password policy creation and enforcement with respect to prevailing “best practices” from an authoritative source (i.e., NIST) across many industries’ websites internet-wide.  This  section summarizes conclusions and suggests some ways to build upon findings.A.ConclusionsThis project used the Verizon DBIR as a starting point to identify  industries  with  the  largest  number  of  cybersecurity  incidents.  Data  were  collected  from  108  randomly  selected  websites  within  nine  industries  known  to  exhibit  a  high  frequency   of   cybersecurity   incidents.   A   few   volunteer   graduate  students  “crowd  sourced”  data  collection  efforts, guided  by  instructional  videos  and  a  step-wise  script.  Eight  variables were created to represent specific aspects of NIST SP 800-63-3 guidance on credentials (passwords), along with a scorecard for assessing each site’s compliance with them. Scores  were aggregated  to  glean  statistical  insights  about  websites internet-wide. Some potential trends were remarked within  industry  verticals;  however  these  sample  sizes  were  too small to have statistical significance.Generalizing from the analysis, many websites that allow
users to create accounts on them still do not enforce a
minimum password length; nor do they forbid common,
easily hacked passwords; nor do they have any account
lockout policy. That is, these sites remain susceptible to brute
force attacks. Industries with the lowest levels of compliance
to NIST password policies were Healthcare, Retail, and
Manufacturing. It was noted, however, that all industries
scored in the 70 to 80 percent range overall, meaning “on
average” they are complying with most NIST password
policy guidance.
B. Future Directions
To build upon this work, more extensive data collection
would be needed. In particular, to draw conclusions within
specific industry categories requires a sample size of 100 or
more per vertical. The experiment also should be repeated
with multiple randomly selected website data sets to confirm
repeatability. Because this study focused on choosing
websites from industries with a high historical incidence of
breaches, a complementary investigation might instead
choose low-reporting industries to determine whether results
correlate to higher compliance with NIST guidance.
Observing additional credential attributes based on NIST
standards and factoring them into the scorecard and analysis
could reveal more insights too. For example, a variable
“Allow Paste” could inspect whether users are able to
copy/paste a value into the password bar, since some
password managers rely on this behavior for logging into
accounts on behalf of the user. NIST guidance also states that
a password must be between 8 and 64 characters long [11].
This project only scrutinized the minimum length
requirement, since shorter passwords are easier to crack. So
adding a “Char Max” variable to the scorecard to check for
maximum length compliance could yield interesting new</p>
